rbcUmbracoOnAzure
=================

Update on 5/21/2015:
You may want to wait until after CG15 to use this package - there is new Load Balancing code being "released" or talked about by Shannon that is in the Core and is targeted to support running Umbraco on Azure with auto-scaling goodness.





Proof of Concept/Experimental project that tries to get Umbraco working across a scaled version of Azure Websites - full details are here:
